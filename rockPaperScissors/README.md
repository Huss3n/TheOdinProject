### Rock Paper Scissors
This is a simple rock paper scissors game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

#### How to Play
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the index.html file in your browser.
3. Click on the "Rock", "Paper", or "Scissors" button to make your move.
4. The computer will randomly choose its move.
5. The result of the game will be displayed on the screen.

#### How it Works
The game is built using JavaScript to handle the logic of the game. When a player clicks on a button, an event listener triggers a function that randomly selects a move for the computer and compares it to the player's move to determine the winner. The result is then displayed on the screen using DOM manipulation.

The styling is done using CSS, which is used to create the buttons and the layout of the game.
